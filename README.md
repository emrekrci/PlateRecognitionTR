# PlateRecognitionTR
https://github.com/emrekrci/PlateRecognitionExamples

This project developed with a OpenCV wrapper, EmguCV and planning to recognize and detect turkish car plate. 
There are 6 steps to recognize car plate. 

1- We will translate colored image to gray.
2- We are using filter to image better.
3- We are using canny algorith to find edges. 
4- We are finding contours. 
5- With plate rate and plate are we are predicting plate region.
6- we are using ocr framework to recognize plate numbers and letters. 

This project is open to improve. You can pull this project and develop for your goal. 

This project is for my representation. The occurency rate is not good. If program does not find your plate, it is normal for sometimes.
